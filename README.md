#1 Classical Arcade Game Clone

Welcome to my first classical arcade game clone. It's an early version with the sole purpose of expanding my javascript skills. The game is currently in its early phase and thus very unpolished.

Aim of the game is to use the arrow keys, to move through locusts in order to reach the water!

To play, just downloadthe zip file, unzip it, and open the index.html file in your browser!

Have fun!
